Terminology and Data
----------------------
 * **OCPI** Open Charge Point Interface
 * **NDR** Notification Detail Record
 * **CDR** Charge Detail Record
 * **CPO** Charging Point Operator
 * **eMSP** e-Mobility Service Provider


## Charging topology

The charging topology, as relevant to the eMSP, consists of three entities:

* *Connector* is a specific socket or cable available for the EV to make use of.
* *EVSE* is the part that controls the power supply to a single EV in a single session. An EVSE may provide multiple connectors but only one of these can be active at the same time.
* *Location* is a group of one or more EVSE's that belong together geographically or spatially.

![Topology](data/topology.png)

A Location is typically the exact location of one or more EVSE's, but it can also be the entrance of a parking garage or a gated community. It is up to the CPO to use whatever makes the most sense in a specific situation. Once arrived at the location, any further instructions to reach the EVSE from the Location are stored in the EVSE object itself (such as the floor number, visual identification or manual instructions).


### Variable names

In order to prevent issues with Capitals in variable names, the naming in JSON is not CamelCase but camel_case. All variables are lowercase and include an underscore for a space.


### Data types

When defining the cardinality of a field, the following symbols are used during the document:

| Symbol | Description                     | Type     |
|--------|---------------------------------|----------|
| ?      | An optional object.             | Object   |
| 1      | Required object.                | Object   |
| *      | A list of zero or more objects. | [Object] |
| +      | A list of at least one object.  | [Object] |


#### Decimals

Decimals are formatted as strings following JSON's number format. They are explicitely expressed as strings to make it clear that they should be interpreted as exact decimals and not as floating points or doubles.

Example:

    "0.68"
    "3.1415"

#### DateTime

All timestamps are formatted as string(25) using the combined date and time format from the ISO 8601 standard. The absence of the timezone designator implies a UTC timestamp.


Example:

    2015-06-29T22:39:09+02:00
    2015-06-29T20:39:09Z
    2015-06-29T20:39:09

#### URL's

An URL a string(255) type following the [w3.org spec](http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/uri-spec.html).

#### Image *class*

This class references images related to a EVSE in terms of a file name or uri. According to the roaming connection between one EVSE Operator and one or more Navigation Service Providers the hosting or file exchange of image payload data has to be defined. The exchange of this content data is out of scope of OCHP. However, the recommended setup is a public available web server hosted and updated by the EVSE Operator. Per charge point a unlimited number of images of each type is allowed. Recommended are at least two images where one is a network or provider logo and the second is a station photo. If two images of the same type are defined they should be displayed additionally, not optionally.

##### Photo Dimensions

The recommended dimensions for all photos are minimum 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels height. Thumbnail representations for photos should always have the same orientation than the original with a size of 200 to 200 pixels.

##### Logo Dimensions

The recommended dimensions for logos are exactly 512 pixels wide and 512 pixels height. Thumbnail representations for logos should be exactly 128 pixels in with and height. If not squared, thumbnails should have the same orientation than the original.

### Data objects

#### Location *class*

The *Location* object describes the location and its properties where a group of EVSE's that belong together are installed. Typically the *Location* object is the exact location of the group of EVSE's, but it can also be the entrance of a parking garage which contains these EVSE's. The exact way to reach each EVSE can then be further specified by its own properties.

A *Location* without valid *EVSE* objects can be considered as expired and should no longer be displayed.

| Property             | Type            | Card. | Description                                            |

| images               | Image           | *     | Links to images related to the location such as photos or logos. |


#### EVSE objects

The *EVSE* object describes the part that controls the power supply to a single EV in a single session. It always belongs to a *Location* object. It will only contain directions to get from the location to the EVSE (i.e. *floor*, *physical_number* or *directions*). When these properties are insufficient to reach the EVSE from the *Location* point, then it typically indicates that this EVSE should be put in a different *Location* object (sometimes with the same address but with different coordinates/directions).

An *EVSE* object has a list of connectors which can not be used simultaneously: only one connector per EVSE may be used at a time. The list of connectors is seen as atomic. This implies that for any changes or updates to a single connector, the full list of all connectors will have to be specified. Any connector not on that list is considered as deleted.

| Property             | Type               | Card. | Description                                            |

| status               | Status             | 1     | Indicates the current status of the EVSE.              |
